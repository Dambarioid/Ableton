                    Rather than having a one-size-fits-all process, we try to give our people what they need to work their 
                    magic and grow. We’ve learned that achieving the best results comes from building teams that are richly 
                    diverse, and thus able to explore problems from a wider set of perspectives. We don’t always agree 
                    with each other, but opinion and debate are valued and openly encouraged.
