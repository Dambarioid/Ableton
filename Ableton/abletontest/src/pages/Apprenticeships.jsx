                    Dual apprenticeship programs have a long tradition in Germany, and they play an important role in the
                    country’s economy. The programs are a proven stepping stone towards a meaningful career without the
                    need for a university degree. They give you the chance to apply theoretical knowledge learned in a
                    vocational school to tasks in the workplace, while you divide your time between class and office days.

                    At Ableton, you'll work towards the Office Management Assistant apprenticeship over two and a half
                    years, developing your professional and personal skills in different teams. We look for people who are
                    highly motivated to work in a commercial office environment, with an excellent level of German and
                    very good English. It’s important that you’re eager to learn, organized in your work, and communicative
                    when collaborating with others. Plus, you should be ready to get the most out of your development
                    through giving and receiving feedback. You can expect a relaxed, professional atmosphere with a
                    dynamic team of people who love music in return.
